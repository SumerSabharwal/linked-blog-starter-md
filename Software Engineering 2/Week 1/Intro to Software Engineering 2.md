## What are projects?

"A project is a **temporary** endeavour undertaken to create a **unique** product, service or result."
## Characteristics of Projects

- Unique, one time set of events
- Mixed elements
	- **Quality**
	- **Cost**
	- **Time**
	- **Scope**
	- **Resources (All about trade offs)**
- Life Cycle (finite deadline)
- Limited resources/budget
- Resources/People throughout the organization and external
- Goal Oriented (specific)
- Numerous, sequenced activities that need planning
- Transient Resources i.e. not stable
- Produce change in organisations

## Projects vs Operations

| **Projects** (e.g. Dam) | **Operations** (e.g. producing baked beans) |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Unique                  | Repetitive                                  |
| FInite                  | Eternal                                     |
| Disequilibrium          | Equilibrium                                 |
| Unbalanced Objectives   | Balanced Objectives                         |
| Transient Resources     | Stable Resources                            |

There are also endeavours that can be classified into both categories:

- Ship building
- Building Houses

## Essence and Accidents

### Essence

**Difficulties in development inherent in the nature of software**

- Complexity - most complex piece of engineering per pound
- Flexibility - can be changed once developed
- Invisibility - unvisualisable i.e. progress is not always visible
	- If you build a bridge you can see it being built unlike software
- Many Solutions - lots of ways to solve a problem

### Accident 

**Difficulties affecting production that are not inherent**

- High-level languages - at a certain point the elaboration of coding languages increases the intellectual task of the user
- Software integration - different platforms, version changes etc.
- Conformity - arbitrary complexities forced by institutions - industry standards
- Future unknowns - what could happen?
	- Bridge can at worst face a hurricane or tsunamis
	- Not predictable for software
- Process is ongoing and unclear
	- When does it end and how to do it
- Expertise lacking 
	- More people can code than build a bridge

## Software Engineering

"Software engineering is the application of **engineering**
to the **development of software** in a **systematic** method."

Note than only 10% of people work on the Project Management Processes

### Project management processes

## Software Life Cycle (SLC)

![[Pasted image 20241216141828.png]]

1. Analysis/Synthesis - e.g. prototyping approach
2. Synthesis/Operation - e.g. incremental delivery
3. Operation/Retirement - e.g. phase out

## Software development models

How the overall software development process is to be performed? What happens in **the stages and between them**?

Advantages for using models:

- **Division** of one big problem into smaller problems
- Provides **progress visibility**
- Supports **planning and control of resources**
- **Improves estimation** of cost and time

### Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

![[Pasted image 20241216142120.png]]

Very generic model for software development. 

### Build and Fix / Code and Fix Model

![[Pasted image 20241217165415.png]]

- Earliest model in developing software
- **Extreme overlap** in analysis, synthesis and operation
- **No formal specification** or requirements analysis

Issues with this model:

- **Structure degrades** after multiple fix cycles
- User requirements are usually not met
- **Costly maintenance** due to poor structure

### Stage Wise Model

**Unidirectional**/sequenced development. Still a naïve process like Build and Fix.

![[Pasted image 20241217170234.png]]

Advantages of this model:

- Encourages one to specify **what the system will do first.**
- Encourages **planning** of the system
- Project managers can **track progress** (more progress visibility)
	- Allows better spotting of errors
- **Documents** must be produced with this model
	- Can be used for evaluation and testing of the system
- All of the above **reduce development and maintenance costs**

## Overview of a stage wise approach

![[Pasted image 20241217172110.png]]

## Classical Waterfall Model

![[Pasted image 20241217172252.png]]

- Simple model, activities are done sequentially
- Extremely unpopular; only 10% like it


![[Pasted image 20241217180824.png]]

## V Process Model

![[Pasted image 20241217180930.png]]


- Refined version of waterfall model
- Emphasises connection between earlier and 


## Bespoke v COTS

### Bespoke

- Development **from scratch** or modify existing system.
- **Tricky to maintain** and **risky** to develop compared to COTS
- Could be for wider market or single customer

### COTS (Commercial Off-The-Shelf)

- **Pre-built** solution for a broader market with predictable costs and **faster implementation.**
- **Easier to maintain** with vendor support, updates, and documentation.
- **Limited flexibility** for unique requirements compared to bespoke systems.

## Techniques

**Things that are used in development stages to support a stage**

Examples:
### Requirements Stage

- Soft Systems: Analysing complex, human-centred problems.
- DFDs (Data Flow diagrams): Visualizing data flow and processes.
- Rich Pictures: Holistic diagrams of the problem.
- Hard Systems: Structured approach for clear, defined problems.
- Structure Charts: Hierarchical breakdown of system modules.
- UML Diagrams

### Design Stage

- JSD (Jackson system development): Process-driven system design.
- OOD (Object oriented design): Object-based modular system design.

## Tools

**Software tools to support the development of software**

IDEs, Testing tools, debugging tools, Trello, Wrike, Task World

## Methods

**Vague term but generally cover how things should be done over several stages** 

• team size and structure
• which overarching model to use
• user involvement
• techniques to use
• documentation to produce, etc.

Examples:

- Proprietary:
	- LSDM
	- Navigator
	- Method1
- Public Domain
	- SSDM
	- Scrum (Agile)
- Home tailored
	- Water Scrum Fall
